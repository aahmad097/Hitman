# Hitman

Stage 1 tool for persistence on a target environment. All implants are meant to be extemely limited with the sole purpose of persisting on a target device and loading Remote Administrative Tools (RATs). 

## Major Components 

Tool consists of 2 major components. Listener and OperatorAPI. Listener is the main API which handles implant session registeration and tasking. OperatorAPI is the operator API which handles operator profiles and session control. 

## Other Info

Although the generic "Cottonmouth" implant is by no means evasive, an "expansion pack" folder is provided so that an operator can modify the generic implant to create a more custom and evasive payload.
